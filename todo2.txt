Hi,



one thing that we SW development persons typically avoid testing on daily basis is release upgrade and downgrade functionality.



So, this could be a nice to cover by test automation if possible. E.g. now that R4.4 is under development, a test case could utilize R4.3 SW like 2N: \\hukka\RD\2 CM\SW\R4.3-2N\CE_board_SW\ce_dnwp_jr2_2n_release_R4_3_r2561.mfi



The test case itself would be something like:



1.      upgrade DUTs by trunk HEAD build.

2.      optionally configure something generic and R4.4 specific; e.g. Ethernet tributary ports

3.      save configurations to startup-config by both CE trunks

4.      downgrade SW to R4.3 level and verify that R4.3 related features are not failing. We expect startup-config failures from R4.4 specific features only.

5.      save configurations by both CE trunks

6.      upgrade SW back to the trunk HEAD builds

7.      checks that R4.4 level features are having correct default values and generic values are similar with step 2.

8.      optionally re-configure R4.4 spesific stuff of step 2 and verify results are identical



Now that R4.4 includes pretty much only new CE trunk stuff, the 2N CE CM is the most important DUT. Still, tests should be done similarly by Hybrid CE and Dyna Wiz too. In those cases steps 2, 4 and  8 are expected to be more or less trivial.



Please, notice that FPGA versions may differ between releases too. It could be nice to add FPGA1 and FPGA2 downgrade/upgrade inside this test case too. This would make test execution time quite long, but if itâ€™s executed during night hours then maybe worth of having.
